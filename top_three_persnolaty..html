        Roshan in 2024
        Hrithik Roshan is an Indian actor known for his work in Hindi-language films. As a child, he made uncredited
        appearances in three films directed by his maternal grandfather, J. Om Prakash, the first of which was in Aasha
        (1980).[1][2] In 1986, Roshan played the adopted son of Rajinikanth's character in Prakash's crime drama
        Bhagwaan Dada.[3] Roshan subsequently worked as an assistant director on four films, including Khudgarz (1987)
        and Karan Arjun (1995), all of which were directed by his father, Rakesh.[1]

        Roshan's first leading role came opposite Ameesha Patel in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), a highly successful
        romantic drama directed by his father, for which he won two Filmfare Awards—Best Male Debut and Best
        Actor.[4][5] In 2001, Roshan played a supporting role in Karan Johar's lucrative ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi
        Kabhie Gham....[6] This initial success was followed by roles in a series of critical and commercial failures,
        including Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage (2002) and Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon (2003), leading critics to believe
        that Roshan's career was over.<br>
        [7][8][9] His career prospects improved in 2003 when he played the role of a
        mentally disabled teenager in his father's science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya.[10] The film emerged as one of
        the highest-grossing Bollywood film of that year and earned Roshan the Best Actor – Critics and the Best Actor
        awards at Filmfare.[11][12] His next release, the war drama Lakshya (2004), performed poorly at the box office
        despite earning positive reviews.[13]

        In 2006, Roshan starred in two top-grossing productions of the year.[14] He portrayed the eponymous superhero in
        Krrish, a sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya, and won another Best Actor award at Filmfare for playing a thief in the
        adventure film Dhoom 2.[15][16] Two years later, he gained a fourth Best Actor award at Filmfare for playing the
        Mughal emperor Akbar in Ashutosh Gowariker's period romance Jodhaa Akbar (2008).<br>
        [17] Roshan starred in two
        commercially unsuccessful films of 2010—Kites and Guzaarish—but earned praise for portraying a quadriplegic
        magician in the latter.[7][18] In 2011, he featured as a talent judge for the television dance reality show Just
        Dance.[19] Roshan also played one of the three leads alongside Farhan Akhtar and Abhay Deol in the Zoya
        Akhtar-directed comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), following which he played a man seeking vengeance
        in Agneepath (2012), a remake of the 1990 film of the same name.<br>
        [20][21] In 2013, Roshan starred in the third
        installment of the Krrish franchise, and the following year, he starred in Bang Bang!, a remake of the 2010
        Hollywood film Knight and Day.[22][23] These films rank among his biggest commercially successes.[24] In 2019,
        Roshan starred in the biopic Super 30, in which he portrayed the mathematician Anand Kumar, and in the action
        thriller War, which ranks as his highest-grossing release.[25][26][27] His first film in three years, the action
        thriller Vikram Vedha (2022), was not financially profitable despite positive reviews.[28]

        comedy-drama Barfi! (2012), he starred as a joyful deaf and mute man.[9] His performance in both films was
        critically acclaimed and he earned two consecutive Best Actor awards at Filmfare and the former also earned him
        a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.[10][11][12] The romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) further
        established him as a star.[7][13]</p>

    <p>Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an
        Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood"
        and "King Khan",[a] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare
        Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des
        Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the
        Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one
        of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and
        connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

        Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood
        debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the
        films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic
        films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998),
        Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida
        Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama
        Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De!
        India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes
        came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in
        Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career
        comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian
        films.</p>
